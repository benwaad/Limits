# Project description

The goal of this project is to produce a series of animations that illustrate how accumulation points of sequences in metric spaces are defined, and how they are connected to the notion of continuity.

Further, I want to use the intuitons developed here to generalize the notion of continuity to general topological spaces, and show how this is an evolution of the epsilon-delta formulation of continuity in single variable calculus. If I'm still not sick of the project after this, I also want to give the intuition of a proof of the equivalence of the two formulations of continuity in metric spaces.
